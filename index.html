  Funny Story
</div>
<p>I was known to be a menace in high school. One day, I decided not to be involved in troubles. That day, the class went bananas on one teacher and started to throw nuts at her while she was not looking. They started to throw nuts at me so I would pick some and participate, but I refused to get involved. The more I refused, the more they threw at me. The teacher looked at me and saw I was surrounded with nuts. No matter how I swore it wasn’t me, she wouldn’t believe me. Can’t blame her my history made it hard to believe. The only day I made a decision to stay away from troubles, I was kicked out from class, sent to the principle, and got my parents called ! Lesson learned, once a menace, stay a menace ! </p>
